# ANIPs

ANIPs are apocryphal [NIPs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips).

This just means that these specs will not necessarily be evaluated
by the main repo maintainers.

Nevertheless, they are grouped here to help devs make their apps interop.

> [!CAUTION]
> Those with file names starting with "wip" (work in progress) can change considerably.

### Other heretical specs:

ANIPs are specs of my own authorship or that I've forked from someone else.
