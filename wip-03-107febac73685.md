# ANIP-03-107febac73685

## Signer Encryption Label

With this NIP a user can grant fine-grained decryption permissions to an app because
this spec enables the NIP-07/46/55 signer to show a detailed permission dialog to the user such as
"*example.com* is asking to decrypt edit keys of the spreadsheet *My Clients*"

### Encryption Label and Context

A label is added when encrypting with NIP-44 to help the signer show a more detailed
permission dialog to its user.

The label is a JSON with optional keys as follows:

```jsonc
{
  isRestricted: true, // default is false
  code, // A string ending with a _[^_]+ pattern, e.g. "ADMIN_KEY_107febac73685", that is defined on each NIP
  kind, // The kind of the event where the ciphertext will be placed
  pubkey, // The pubkey of the event where the ciphertext will be placed
  // The event unique identifier (last portion of the ANIP-01 "U" tag),
  // e.g. "d71238929173", from a "d" tag set to 71238929173. Adding
  // a "d" or "dd" tag to the event is required
  uid
}
```

The `isRestricted` label flag when true means the signer shouldn't allow the app to access the plaintext directly,
i.e. the `nip44.decrypt(...)` signer method call MUST fail.

When encrypting, the signer adds some strings to the plaintext like this:
``#!N3r <plaintext>`<isRestricted ? 1 : 0>:<code, optional>:<kind, optional>:<pubkey, optional>:<uid, optional>``.
If the plaintext contains `´` chars, escape them with a preceding `-`.

Example: `#!N3r red-´grape´0:FRUIT_9d10d210f580d:123:abc..def:d1265721`.

Encryption example: `const ciphertext = await nostr.nip44.encrypt("<peer pubkey>", "red´grape", null, label)`

When decrypting, the client may pass events it deems useful as context for the signer to extract
even more detail.

The context is an array of nostr events, e.g. `[{<some nostr event>}]`

Decryption example: `await nostr.nip44.decrypt("<peer pubkey>", "<ciphertext>", null, context)`

### Recommendations

#### Misc

Gift-wraps and seals upon decryption reveal their event kinds. That is, if
a decrypted data doesn't have a `"#!N3r "` prefix, the signer should
fallback to `JSON.parse(plaintext)`, check if it is a gift-wrap or seal
and possibly use the event kind to assist the user with a more detailed permission dialog.

#### Chat Messages

Fine-grained decryption permissions for apps reduces the damage
an app can do. However, chat messages have open-ended scopes.

Prefer using a trusted client that is solely a messenger or
a trusted signer that has the single extra feature of also being a messenger.
